Iris Dataset Classification using k-NN

Implemented a k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) classifier on the Iris dataset to classify iris species (setosa, versicolor, virginica) based on four features:

Sepal length

Sepal width

Petal length

Petal width

Key Tasks Completed:
1. Load and explore the Iris dataset
2. Visualize features using pairplots, heatmaps representing correlation values and box plots.
3. Train and test a KNN classifier
4. Connect distance-based learning to vector space
5. Relate classification results to class probabilities
6. Split data into training/testing
7. Train a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model
8. Test with different k values (1, 3, 5, 7)

Key Result

Best Model: k=3 or k=5 (96.7% accuracy)

Libraries Used: scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

Data Split: 70% training, 30% testing (stratified)

Distance Metric: Euclidean (L2)

Evaluation: 5-fold CV + test set metrics

Key Learnings
1. Load and explore the Iris dataset
